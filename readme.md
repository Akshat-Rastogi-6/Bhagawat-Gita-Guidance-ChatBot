# Bhagavad Gita RAG Bot

## Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system leveraging the profound wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita. The primary goal is to provide users with an interactive way to explore the teachings of the Gita, answer specific questions related to its content, and receive guidance based on its timeless principles.

The bot uses the Bhagavad Gita as its core knowledge document. When a user asks a question or seeks guidance, the RAG system retrieves the most relevant passages from the text and then uses a large language model to generate a coherent and contextually appropriate response.

## Features

*   **Contextual Question Answering:** Ask questions about verses, chapters, characters, themes, and philosophical concepts within the Bhagavad Gita.
*   **Guidance Based on Teachings:** Receive insights and guidance inspired by the principles and wisdom imparted in the Gita.
*   **RAG Implementation:** Ensures answers are grounded in the actual text of the Bhagavad Gita, enhancing accuracy and relevance.

## How it Works

1.  **Document Processing:** The Bhagavad Gita text is processed and indexed (likely into a vector database) for efficient retrieval.
2.  **Query Input:** The user submits a question or request for guidance.
3.  **Retrieval:** The system identifies and retrieves the most relevant sections or verses from the indexed Bhagavad Gita based on the user's query.
4.  **Generation:** A large language model synthesizes the retrieved information along with the original query to generate a comprehensive and informative response.

## Usage

```bash
# Example interaction (conceptual)
User: What does the Bhagavad Gita say about duty?
Bot: The Bhagavad Gita emphasizes the importance of performing one's prescribed duties (Svadharma) without attachment to the results... [provides more detail based on retrieved verses]
```
